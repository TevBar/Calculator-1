Calculator App
A responsive, accessible, and fully‑functional calculator built with modern front‑end development practices. This project goes beyond a basic four‑function calculator by emphasizing clean component architecture, state management, and user‑focused interaction design. It serves as a demonstration of my ability to build polished, production‑ready interfaces using React.

✨ Features
Core arithmetic operations  
Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with real‑time expression evaluation.

Chained calculations  
Users can continue performing operations without resetting the calculator, mirroring real device behavior.

Clear and delete functionality  
Includes “AC” (all clear) and “DEL” (delete last input) for intuitive error correction.

Responsive layout  
Designed to adapt smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

Keyboard support  
Users can interact using either on‑screen buttons or their keyboard for faster input.

Error handling  
Prevents invalid expressions, division by zero, and malformed input sequences.

Component‑driven architecture  
Built with reusable React components and clear separation of logic and UI.

🧠 Technical Highlights
React functional components with hooks for state and event handling

Custom calculation logic that parses and evaluates expressions safely

CSS grid layout for clean, scalable button arrangement

Modular file structure for maintainability and readability

User‑centric interaction design inspired by physical calculator behavior

🚀 Why This Project Matters
Although a calculator may seem simple at first glance, building one correctly requires careful attention to:

State transitions

Input validation

Edge‑case handling

UI responsiveness

Consistent user experience

These are the same skills front‑end developers use when building real‑world applications. This project demonstrates my ability to translate requirements into a clean, reliable, and user‑friendly interface.
